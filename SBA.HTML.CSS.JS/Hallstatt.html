        <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Hallstatt is a village on Lake Hallstatt's western shore in Austria's mountainous Salzkammergut region. 
            Its 16th-century Alpine houses and alleyways are home to cafes and shops. A funicular railway connects to Salzwelten, an ancient salt mine with a subterranean salt lake,
             and to Skywalk Hallstatt viewing platform.
             A trail leads to the Echern Valley glacier garden with glacial potholes and Waldbachstrub Waterfall.</p>

            Hallstatt in Winter
            The problems and opportunities of greatly-increased tourism in Hallstatt were covered by The Washington Post in August 2019.[15] Halstatt's tourism began in the 19th century but greatly increased after it was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1997.
             It became popular among East Asian tourists in 2006 when it was featured on a South Korean television show.[17]
            Social media images of Hallstatt, captioned "the most Instagrammable town in the world," went viral in Southeast Asia.
             A replica was planned and then built in China in 2011 in Huizhou, Guangdong province, Hallstatt's twin town.
             In 2013 it was rumored in China to be the model for the movie Frozen's Arendelle village.
             By 2017 local churches were employing bouncers to prevent services being disrupted by tourists.[16] In 2020 the town had a population of 780, and estimates of 10,000 to nearly 30,000 tourists per day,
             primarily via bus tours which bring tourists briefly into the town for photo opportunities, then quickly move on.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 30px;">Hallstatt A–B are part of the Bronze Age Urnfield culture. Phase A saw Villanovan influence. In this period, people were cremated and buried in simple graves. In phase B, tumulus (barrow or kurgan) burial becomes common, and cremation predominates.
             Little is known about this period in which the typical Celtic elements have not yet distinguished themselves from the earlier Villanova-culture.
             The "Hallstatt period" proper is restricted to HaC and HaD (8th to 5th centuries BC), corresponding to the early European Iron Age. Hallstatt lies in the area where the western and eastern zones of the Hallstatt culture meet, which is reflected in the finds from there.[9] Hallstatt D is succeeded by the La Tène culture.

            Hallstatt C is characterized by the first appearance of iron swords mixed amongst the bronze ones. Inhumation and cremation co-occur.
             For the final phase, Hallstatt D, daggers, almost to the exclusion of swords, are found in western zone graves ranging from c. 600–500 BC.[7]: 40  There are also differences in the pottery and brooches. 
             Burials were mostly inhumations. Halstatt D has been further divided into the sub-phases D1–D3, relating only to the western zone, and mainly based on the form of brooches.</p>
